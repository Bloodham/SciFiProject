                           On this page,  we appreciate three heroes that have really helped paving the way for the International Fleet ! We talk about each
                           generation and how our three heroes span over these different generations and all have been able to help in their own way with the beating 
                           back of the buggers!

                           Mazer Rackham is a hero among heroes ! Mazer Rackham and his formation was able to successfuly fend of the second invasion.
                           Through these heroics, the International Fleet was able to set up their defensive line and beat back the remaining buggers, we 
                           owe our very lives to Mazer Rackham and his incredible courage !
