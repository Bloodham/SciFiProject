                          On this page, we appreciate three heroes that have really helped pave the way for the International Fleet! We talk about each
                           generation and how our three heroes span over these different generations and all have been able to help in their own way with the beating 
                           back of the buggers!

                           Mazer Rackham is a hero among heroes! Mazer Rackham and his formation was able to successfully fend of the second invasion.
                           Through these heroics, the International Fleet was able to set up their defensive line and beat back the remaining buggers, we 
                           owe our very lives to Mazer Rackham and his incredible courage!

                           Colonel Graff is the administrator at Battle School that is currently orbiting around earth. Colonel Graff hand picked Ender Wiggins to become one of our best
                           and brightest today. We not only owe Colonel Graff our gratitude but our praise as he has become a hero of International Fleet for bringing
                           our greatest commander to our fold!

                         Andrew "Ender" Wiggins is our finest commander that we have today! Right now, Ender Wiggins is training in an undisclosed location to beat back the buggers
                          for when they try to attack Earth again. We have put all of our hopes and dreams on this young boy and at such an young age, Ender has shown us that he is the best
                          of the International Federation. We thank him for all that he is doing and for all that he will do in the near future.
